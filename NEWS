  modal verbs.

MINOR FEATURES

IMPROVEMENTS

* `hash_valence_shifters` added following negators: "daren't", "hadn't",
  "needn't", "oughtn't"; the following amplifiers: "absolutely", "considerably",
  "decidedly", "especially", "majorly", "most", "uber"; the following
  de-amplifiers: "almost", "kind of", "kinda", "partly", "somewhat", "sort of",
  "sorta".  In addition, all contraction negators were re-added
  to the `hash_valence_shifters` sans apostrophe as cleaning or less formal
  writing may result in contractions without apostrophes.

CHANGES

*  The word "incredibly" was removed from `hash_sentiment_jockers`,
  `hash_sentiment_huliu`, & `hash_sentiment_sentiword` and added as an amplifier
  to `hash_valence_shifters`.  Spotted by AbdulMajedRaja:
  https://github.com/trinker/sentimentr/issues/58#issuecomment-343373693

----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

  was spotted by Mitchell Linegar (see https://github.com/trinker/textstem/issues/5).
  The token `also` has been removed from the dictionary.


NEW FEATURES

* `pos_df_irregular_nouns` and `pos_unchanging_nouns` added.  The former is a
  data.frame of singular and plural forms of irregular nouns.  The latter is
